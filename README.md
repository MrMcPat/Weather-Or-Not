# Description

- Developed a weather web application that provides the user a message(such as to bring an umbrella) based on the weather conditions.

- Used JavaScript/HTML/CSS for Front-End with a simple json server (fake REST API)  to log saved addresses.

- Designed a minimalistic user interface to contrast the information heavy weather related websites.

- Used two external APIs: to retrieve location coordinates and to obtain weather data based on coordinates.
